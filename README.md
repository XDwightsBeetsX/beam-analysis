Perform engineering analysis on beams with diagrams for shear, moments, angle, and deflection  

## Usage üíª

```shell
pip install beam_analysis
```

```shell
git clone https://github.com/XDwightsBeetsX/beam-analysis
```

## Mechanical Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

- Currently reactions are not solved for...
  - All loads and reactions must be inputted
- Boundary conditions currently required
  - one angle *AND* one deflection value
  - *OR* two deflection parameters
- Beam weight is not accounted for by default
  - represent it with a distributed load

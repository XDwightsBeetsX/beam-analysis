# beam-analysis  :construction_worker  

Perform engineering analysis on beams with diagrams for shear, moments, angle, and deflection  

## Usage

```pip install beam-analysis```  
*currently at work*

## Mechanical Requirements

- Curently `E, I, & L` as well as added loads must be in SI units  

- All loads on the beam must be inputted  
  - This does no solving  

## Build Requirements

- Check the `requirements.txt`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
